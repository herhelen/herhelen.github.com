This is a song that's really warmhearted.
It's one of the theme from "The Fierce Wife", a Taiwanese drama.
I think this will be one of songs that I'd sing for "The one" if I find him. [which means, never]

靠近你就覺得安心  
I feel safe when I get close to you  

因為你那雙愛笑眼睛  
Because of your eyes love to smile  

你笑我 貓一樣好奇  
You make fun of me "curious as a cat"  

聰明裡偏又透著傻氣  
A little dumb in the smartness  

Darling 我想告訴你  
Darling I want to tell you  

其實我比你愛我更愛你  
In fact I love you more than you love me  

善解人意 浪漫話語  
Empathetic romantic lines  

彷彿一切命中注定  
As if all is fated   

你的體貼 溫暖了我的心  
Your caring warmed my heart  

就像夏天的風吹過那麼涼爽安靜  
Just like summer breeze blew so refreshing and quiet  

我輕輕依偎在你的懷裡  
I stay in your arms  

天空掛滿祝福的星星  
Sky is full of blessing stars  

你的體貼 溫暖了我的心  
Your caring warmed my heart  

就像傾盆大雨 捨不得淋濕愛你的心  
Like the pouring rain can't bear to wet my heart  

我要唱給你聽 陶醉在你給的甜蜜  
I want to sing for you and drown in your sweetness
