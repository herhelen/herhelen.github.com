The Notebook is novel written by Nicholas Sparks.  
There's an adaption to the movies.  

I watched the movie first, then I read the book (borrowed from Lina).  

While I was reading the book, I was thinking if I would be capable to do what Noah did for Allie.  
To be there for her, and try to bring a miracle and support his own illness.  
Maybe this is the real love, and only a few couple will find it.  
And I wonder if I expect this kind of love in my life, sometimes I wish I have a great love story, and yet sometimes I wish I have a love that I can't describe with words.  

Well, there's two quotes from the book that I liked, but there's more, and I forgot to write it down.  

> Poetry, she thought, wasn't written to be analyzed; it was meant to inspire without reason, to touch without understanding.

> You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. 
> You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have. 
> I love you, Allie, more than you can ever imagine. I always have...
