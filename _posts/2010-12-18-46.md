It's been awhile that I wrote here.  
Well, this year is almost ending,
and the greatest news is that I didn't fail in Physics,
but I failed in Algorithm Analysis.  
So, I'll only be able to graduate next year.

Besides that, I'm looking for internships.  
Although I'm 23, sometimes I just feel like a child.  
Every one is moving forward to their dreams and future.  
I'm stuck in here, not knowing what to do next.  

Sometimes just feeling I'm such a loser.  
I wanna run away and just that.  

Yoga's song is very touching.  

That's all for today
