# 林凡 - 五天幾年 #

When I heard this song, I thought it's sad.  
It's really a miracle when you love someone and be love by that same person.  

This song represents when you're in love, but then later, the love you both used to have is gone, what you can do if you still in love with him?  
And worse if you've got hurt because he just can't decide between you and his new girlfriend.

也許在你心裡夢是自己的   
Maybe in your mind that dream is only yours  

可是在我心裡夢是我們的  
But in my mind that dream belongs to us  

你說你要自由我給你自由  
You said you want to be free and I set you free  

你說你要安靜我安靜的像宇宙  
You said you want yo be quiet and I’m quiet like the universe  

如果說這是愛 醒來好像夢一場  
If this is love it’s like I woke up from a dream  

如果說這是愛 我情願去流浪  
If this is love I prefer to wander  

如果說這是愛 請你鬆開我肩膀   
If this is love please release my shoulder  

如果說這是愛 靜靜的 等天亮  
If this is love quietly I wait for the daybreak  

看你露出微笑像個小孩子  
When you laugh looks like a child  

看你不再彷徨 也不再祈禱  
You’re not lost anymore don’t pray anymore  

曾經覺得你是曾經那個你   
Once I thought you’re the old you  

曾經覺得自己比誰都瞭解愛  
Once I thought I understand love more than anyone  

眼看著雨   
I see the rain  

眼看著雨點   
I see the raindrop  

眼看著雨點落在了心裡  
I saw the raindrop fell into my heart  

如果說這是愛 愛你好像是夢一場  
If this is love it’s like I woke up from a dream  

如果說這是愛 我情願被遺忘  
If this is love I prefer to be forgotten  

如果說這是愛 請你鬆開我肩膀  
If this is love please release my shoulder  

如果說這是愛 等著你到天亮  
If this is love quietly I wait for you until the daybreak
