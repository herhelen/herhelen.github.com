In past few days I was feeling down.  
So I began to watch a lot of movies and American series.
And _Hear me_ is one of these movies.

Sinopse\[1\]:
> Hear me centres on the story of a young and cheerful Yang Yang who single-handedly takes of her sister, a swimmer-in-training for the Deaflympics.
> 
> By chance, Yang Yang meets Tian Kuo, who delivers lunch boxes to the swimming pool where Peng trains. 
> 
> With sign language as their sole means of communication, the couple’s burgeoning for each other transcends their obvious language barrier, a light-hearted romantic comedy about and its possibilities.
> 
> Hear Me is largely non-verbal, its dialogue taking place mostly via sign language and the use of body language to convey their thoughts.

It's a heart warming movie, nice soundtracks, sweet romance.

It's funny to realize that we tend to assume things, like other day I had Japanese test, which is to write in kanji what is written in hiragana, 
I read ついたら but it was actually written ついたち, so I failed in this exercise. =/  
Same thing happened in this movie, which is very funny ^^.  

Hope you would enjoy it if you watch it.
