Well, I've known that I graduated for awhile, but you never realize that is happening, until now.
I'm moving back to SP today, and Monday will be my first day at new job.
Future is becoming Present too fast, maybe I need a break between my college and work, travel and see the world with my onw eyes. And then, there's a problem, money.

Thusday was my last day at my internship, it was quite nice, though was short.
You see, I was planning to stay here, in Campinas, if my intership becomes a job, and then I could try master degree, and study more. But, future never works as we planned it.

There's no words to describe or to thank that people has done for me, my dear friends, you're the best ones ;)

So, just keep in touch!
