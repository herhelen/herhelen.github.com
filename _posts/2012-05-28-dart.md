Today was the first day of Dart Hackathon at São Paulo, Brazil. 
It was quite exciting to learn about Dart, and somehow try to contribute to Dart lang team by giving some feedback or reporting a bug or even suggesting some improvement. 
Although, I wasn't able to do any of that, being there with enthusiastic people was really really great. I want to thank for people who organized the event, and made it happen. ;)
But this post is not just it, Otavio from Google gave an idea that I want to try, just to code something in Dart. 
Well, the idea is using the sample Clock and make it show time in other time zones, something similar to [What time is it!] (http://www.whattimeisit.com/) (ah, this is a great site for those people who are taking online courses at <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>)
